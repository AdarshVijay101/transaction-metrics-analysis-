Real-Time Financial Transactions Streaming Pipeline Using Azure
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time streaming pipeline for financial transactions using Azure services.
It simulates a continuous stream of transaction data and processes it in real-time to identify potentially fraudulent activity.

Key components include:

Azure Data Factory (simulate streaming ingestion)

Azure Databricks with PySpark Structured Streaming (process data)

Delta Lake on Azure Blob Storage (store outputs)

Fraud detection: transactions over $10,000 are flagged as suspicious.

The pipeline works end-to-end and processes new transactions within seconds.

Technologies Used
Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Azure Databricks (PySpark)

Azure Blob Storage

Delta Lake

Structured Streaming

How to Run
Set up Azure Blob Storage
Create two containers: raw-transactions, processed-transactions

Configure Databricks Cluster
Mount both Blob containers.

Create ADF Pipeline
Copy simulated transactions into raw-transactions with a trigger.

Run Databricks Streaming Job
Read new files, apply fraud detection logic, write to Delta.

Monitor
Observe results in processed folder + query Delta Lake tables.

Sample Results

Time	Total Transactions	Suspicious Transactions
2025-04-26 13:00	120	3
2025-04-26 13:01	134	2
Future Improvements ðŸš€
Implement ML models for fraud prediction (instead of thresholding)

Live real-time dashboard (Power BI, Synapse Serverless Pool)

Handle late-arriving transactions (advanced windowing in Spark)
